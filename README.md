# Platelet Simulation

## Introduction

The project aims all researchers to study the platelet, or any object looks like ellipsoid by using molecular dynamics in flow easily. Here, we use an open-source package Distmesh (http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/) to generate the positions for particles, and output to standard LAMMPS data file.
Also, I provided a demo that the random movement ellipsoid in the flow. I will update the repo and share my research progress.
